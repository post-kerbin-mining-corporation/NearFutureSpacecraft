## Features

A number of parts designed to help build better and cooler orbital (and not so orbital) spacecraft, including:

* **Orbital Command Pods:**  New command pods, focused on orbital operations with better comms and control
* **Advanced Command Pods:** Command pods that are similar to stock's offerings, but uprated
* **Lander Command Pods:** Command pods with integral slots for landing engines
* **Monopropellant Tanks:** A full set of monopropellant tanks in 1.25m, 2.5m and 3.75m sizes
* **Service Fuel Tanks:** A few service bay/fuel tank combinations
* **Advanced RCS Thrusters:** High efficiency orbital RCS thrusters
* **Orbital Monopropellant Engines:** Specialized, efficient engines for orbital use fuelled by monopropellant
* **Landing Monopropellant Engines:** Specialized and high thrust engines for lander and abort system use
* **IVAs:** All the pods have fully featured IVAs, and some have more complex RPM IVAs

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (3.1.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.6.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)
* [Near Future Props (0.5.0)](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/NearFutureProps)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Optional Patches

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the **Extras** folder into your KSP GameData Folder

* **OrbitalLFOEngines**: Converts the orbital monoprop engines to use LF/O 

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use
* ASET Props: If ASET Props and RPM are installed, certain command pods will have RPM layouts
* Connected Living Spaces: Correctly marks parts as passable or impassable
* TAC-LS: sets up relevant life support for parts
* USI-LS:  sets up relevant life support for parts

Note that the vast majority of this compatibility is community-sourced and not maintained by me.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
