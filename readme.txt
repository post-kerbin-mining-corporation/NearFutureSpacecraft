============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place some parts in new nodes.

KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
